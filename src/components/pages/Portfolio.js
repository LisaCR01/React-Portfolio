      <p>
      I’m an accomplished digital artist with a background in both STEM and art related fields; embarking on a design career in both physical and virtual spaces. I have experience in frontend and backend development, with a particular interest in using CSS frameworks to create aesthetic applications. My knowledge within web development means I am able to create fully responsive applications with polished interfaces. I will complete the Birmingham coding bootcamp in May.I’m based in the Midlands, and open to remote part-time working, to fit in with my architectural studies.
